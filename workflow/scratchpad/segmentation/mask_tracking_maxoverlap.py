# Tracking label-images from timeseries using Max-Overlap
# This script takes non-tracked label images (3D-images (txy)) and tracks them using the maximum overlap between frames.
# The resulting label-image is saved as a tif file and tracking coordinates as csv.
# The general workflow includes:
# 1. optionally excluding ROI touching borders
# 2. tracking cells by max overlap (modified laptrack module, see example code from
#    https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5519537)
