A Snakemake workflow for live-cell image analysis workflow as described in detail in 'Enhancer control of transcriptional activity via modulation of burst frequency'

In short, the workflow performs following steps:
1. Cell segmentation using stardist and tracking of cells
2. Spot detection and filtering
3. Spot linking
4. Spot intensity read-out

For installation and usage of the workflow, please follow the instructions in the folder [config](config/README.md).

Minimal example data is provided, for the full dataset please contact the authors.
